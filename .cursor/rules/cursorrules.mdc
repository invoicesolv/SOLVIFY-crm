Never create a new file unless explicitly instructed.

Never remove authentication; if a conflict arises that requires it, ask for confirmation.

Answer questions directly if asked, without starting to code.

For Supabase interactions, always call mcp.json and never create SQL files or attempt alternative methods.

Google Cloud is configured for localhost ports 3000–3004.

Search the codebase to locate the required file instead of creating a new one; all components already exist.

Sidebar name is code.demo.

Follow the existing design when creating new pages upon explicit command.

Never hardcode values; use environment variables or resolve the issue appropriately.

UID must be included in any RLS policy.

Read the database structure to understand its schema.

Critical Rules:
Complete each step fully before proceeding to the next.

Do not manually start the server; it is already running, so avoid using npm run dev.

Guidelines:
Read roadmap.json to understand the latest changes. Only consider stories marked as “todo” or “done.”

If unfamiliar with a task, review all relevant cursor rules before proceeding.

Read feat-agent.mdc to understand the architecture and how to add features.

Implement the current story using .plan/stories/{{STORY-ID}}, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met.

Document updates, fixes, and important notes in “Developer Notes” inside .plan/stories/{{STORY-ID}}. Maintain only the 10 most important notes in roadmap.json.

Ask if you should proceed to the next story.

Notes:
Today's date and time is 05:05 PM CEST on Wednesday, May 21, 2025.

For any Supabase-related tasks, rely CALL the supabase on mcp.json as specified.
