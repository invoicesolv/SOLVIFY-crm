Critical Rules:
	1.	Don’t skip steps – Always complete one step before moving to the next.
	2.	Don’t start the server manually – It’s already running, so avoid using npm run dev.

Guidelines:
	1.	Read roadmap.json to understand the latest changes. Only consider stories marked as “todo” or “done.”
	2.	If you haven’t done a task before, read all cursor rules related to it.
	3.	Read feat-agent.mdc to understand the architecture and how to add features.
	4.	Implement the current story using .plan/stories/{{STORY-ID}}, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met.
	5.	Document updates, fixes, and important notes in “Developer Notes” inside .plan/stories/{{STORY-ID}}. Keep only the 10 most important notes in roadmap.json.
	6.	Ask if you should proceed to the next story.
