# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Month-by-Month Transaction and Receipt Processing

### Overview
The goal is to implement a month-by-month processing system for AI agents to enhance performance, accuracy, and user experience. This system will segment transactions and receipts by month, process them one at a time, and require user confirmation before moving to the next month.

### Goals
- **Improve Matching Accuracy**: Focus on time-relevant data.
- **Reduce Performance Issues**: Limit batch sizes.
- **Enhance User Control**: Allow users to manage the matching process.
- **Incremental Review**: Enable users to review and confirm matches incrementally.
- **Status Visibility**: Clearly display processing status for each month.

### User Experience

#### Month Selection and Navigation
- Automatically identify all months in the transaction data.
- Start processing with the earliest month by default.
- Display a timeline view of all available months with their status (pending, processing, complete).
- Allow users to navigate between months after completing the current month.

#### Processing Flow
- **Receipt Fetcher Agent**: Segments transactions by month.
- **Current Month Processing**:
  - Receipt AI Agent processes receipts from the current month.
  - Transaction Matcher Agent matches transactions and receipts for the current month.
  - Display results to the user for review.
  - Require user confirmation to proceed to the next month.
  - Automatically skip months with no transactions or receipts.

#### User Controls
- "Confirm & Continue" button to proceed to the next month after review.
- "Skip Month" button to manually skip the current month.
- Error display with details if processing fails.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Month Segmentation**
   - Add a function to group transactions by month (YYYY-MM format).
   - Create a state to track the current month being processed.
   - Implement filtering functions for selecting transactions and receipts for the current month.

2. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Create a component to manage month-by-month processing flow.
   - Track processing status for each month (pending, processing, complete, error, skipped).
   - Implement user confirmation controls.
   - Add navigation between processed months.

3. **UI Components**
   - Timeline view showing all months with status indicators.
   - Current month display with transaction and receipt counts.
   - Confirmation dialog after month processing completes.
   - Error display with retry option.

4. **Data Management**
   - Temporary storage for processed month results.
   - State management to track overall progress.
   - Functions to combine results from all processed months.

### Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1: Month Segmentation**
  - Implement functions to segment transactions by month.
  - Add state management for tracking the current month.
  - Create filtering functions for month-specific processing.

- **Phase 2: UI Components**
  - Develop timeline view for month navigation.
  - Create month status indicators.
  - Implement confirmation dialogs.

- **Phase 3: Flow Control**
  - Add user confirmation requirements.
  - Implement automatic skipping for empty months.
  - Create error handling and display.

- **Phase 4: Integration**
  - Connect all components to create an end-to-end flow.
  - Ensure proper data passing between agents.
  - Test with various data scenarios.

### Success Criteria
- Users can process transactions month by month.
- Matching accuracy improves due to focused time periods.
- Performance issues with large batches are eliminated.
- Users have clear visibility into processing status.
- Error handling provides clear information when issues occur.

### Non-Goals
- Permanent storage of processed results (future enhancement).
- Changing the core matching algorithms.
- Supporting batch sizes other than months.
- Automatic processing without user confirmation.

This PRD outlines the plan to implement month-by-month processing while preserving the core functionality of the existing AI agents. The approach focuses on extending the current system rather than modifying it, ensuring stability while adding new capabilities.
