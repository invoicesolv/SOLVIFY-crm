# Product Requirements Document: Animation Improvements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving animations and adding smoother movements to the Vibe CRM application. The goal is to enhance the user experience by making the interface feel more polished, responsive, and engaging.

## 2. Goals

*   **Improve User Experience:** Make the application feel more modern and enjoyable to use.
*   **Enhance Perceived Performance:** Use animations to mask loading times and make transitions feel smoother.
*   **Provide Visual Feedback:** Use animations to provide clear feedback to user interactions.
*   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure animations are consistent across the application.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure animations do not negatively impact users with disabilities or those who prefer reduced motion.

## 3. Target Audience

All users of the Vibe CRM application.

## 4. Scope

This project focuses on adding and improving animations throughout the application, including:

*   Page transitions
*   Sidebar animations
*   List and grid item loading
*   Button and form element interactions
*   Loading indicators
*   Hover and focus states
*   Toast notifications (ensure consistency)

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1 Functional Requirements:

| ID  | Description                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | Implement page transition animations using Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence`.                           |
| FR2 | Enhance sidebar animations for expansion/collapse and icon transitions.                                  |
| FR3 | Add staggered loading animations to lists and grids (e.g., file list in Drive, customer list).            |
| FR4 | Implement subtle hover and focus animations for interactive elements (buttons, links, cards, form inputs). |
| FR5 | Refine loading indicators to be visually appealing and consistent.                                      |
| FR6 | Ensure toast notifications have consistent and smooth animations.                                        |
| FR7 | Add micro-interactions to form elements (e.g., slight bounce on focus).                                 |
| FR8 | Implement a system for managing animation constants (duration, easing, delay).                          |

### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements:

| ID   | Description                                                                                               |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NFR1 | **Performance:** Animations must be performant and not cause jank or slowdowns. Target 60fps.             |
| NFR2 | **Responsiveness:** Animations must adapt to different screen sizes.                                      |
| NFR3 | **Accessibility:** Provide a way to disable or reduce animations for users who prefer reduced motion.     |
| NFR4 | **Maintainability:** Animations should be easy to maintain and update. Use a consistent approach.        |
| NFR5 | **Consistency:** Animations should follow a consistent design language.                                  |
| NFR6 | **Subtlety:** Animations should be subtle and enhance the user experience, not distract from it.          |

## 6. Animation Principles

*   **Easing:** Use a consistent easing curve (e.g., cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)) for most animations.
*   **Duration:** Use a small set of standard durations (e.g., 0.2s, 0.3s, 0.5s).
*   **Delay:** Use delays sparingly, primarily for staggered animations.
*   **Motion:** Prefer natural and intuitive motion (e.g., slide-in from the direction of origin, fade-in with slight scale-up).

## 7. Technical Design

*   **Library:** Framer Motion will be the primary animation library.
*   **Animation Constants:** A central file (`lib/animations.ts`) will store animation constants.
*   **Reusable Animations:** Define reusable animation variants in `lib/animations.ts`.
*   **motion Components:** Use Framer Motion's `motion` components for declarative animations.
*   **AnimatePresence:** Use `AnimatePresence` for page transitions.
*   **useReducedMotion Hook:** Use the `useReducedMotion` hook to respect user preferences for reduced motion.
*   **Tailwind Integration:** Use Tailwind classes for basic transitions and animations where appropriate.

## 8. Implementation Plan (Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: Foundation

*   Create `lib/animations.ts` and define animation constants.
*   Implement basic page transition animations.
*   Add `useReducedMotion` hook handling.

### Phase 2: Core Components

*   Enhance sidebar animations.
*   Add hover/focus animations to buttons and links.
*   Refine loading indicators.

### Phase 3: Page-Specific Enhancements

*   **Drive Page:** Staggered loading for file list, entrance animations for cards.
*   **Dashboard:** Entrance animations for cards.
*   **Customers/Projects/Invoices:** Staggered loading for lists.
*   **Forms:** Micro-interactions on focus.

### Phase 4: Refinement and Polish

*   Review all animations for consistency and performance.
*   Address any accessibility issues.
*   Fine-tune durations and easing curves.

## 9. Testing

*   **Visual Inspection:** Manually inspect animations on different screen sizes and browsers.
*   **Performance Testing:** Use browser developer tools to measure animation performance (FPS).
*   **Accessibility Testing:** Test with reduced motion enabled.
*   **User Testing:** Gather feedback from users on the new animations.

## 10. Open Issues

*   Specific animation details for certain components may need further refinement during implementation.
*   Need to decide on the specific loading animation style.

## 11. Success Metrics

*   Improved user satisfaction (measured through surveys or feedback).
*   Reduced perceived loading times.
*   Positive feedback on the visual polish of the application.
*   No performance regressions (measured by FPS and user reports).
*   Accessibility compliance.

This PRD provides a comprehensive plan for improving animations in your application. I can now start implementing Phase 1, beginning with creating the `lib/animations.ts` file and setting up basic page transitions. Do you agree with this plan, and would you like me to proceed with Phase 1?
